    "title": "What Does it Take to be a Top 5 College Football Team Offensively",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Similar to the NCAA Basketball AP rankings, college football has their own top 25 ranked teams. I went and compared the top five squads from the 2023 preseason to the end of the season. Specifically looking at their offensive stats and how they differed. Breaking them down into two main categories of offense: passing and rushing. With sub-categories of passing percentage, passing yards, and passing touchdowns for passing the ball. Then rushing average, rushing yards, and rushing touchdowns for running the ball.\nI believe that to stand out and be known as an elite squad you must excel on the offensive end of the ball. College football games tend to have high scoring results and which team can put the ball in the end-zone most efficiently will rise to the top.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\n\nfball &lt;- read_csv(\"footballlogs23.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 1702 Columns: 54\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): HomeAway, Opponent, Result, TeamFull, TeamURL, Outcome, Team, Con...\ndbl  (45): Game, PassingCmp, PassingAtt, PassingPct, PassingYds, PassingTD, ...\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\npretop5pass &lt;- fball |&gt;\n  filter(TeamFull==\"Georgia Bulldogs\"|\n          TeamFull==\"Michigan Wolverines\"|\n          TeamFull==\"Ohio State Buckeyes\"|\n          TeamFull==\"Alabama Crimson Tide\"|\n          TeamFull==\"LSU Fighting Tigers\"\n         )|&gt;\n  select(TeamFull, PassingPct, PassingYds, PassingTD) |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    TotalPassPct = sum(PassingPct)/12,\n    TotalPassYds = sum(PassingYds),\n    TotalPassTD = sum(PassingTD))\n\npretop5pass |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    TeamFull = \"Team\",\n    TotalPassPct = \"Total Passing Percentage\",\n    TotalPassYds = \"Total Passing Yards\",\n    TotalPassTD = \"Total Passing Touchdowns\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How well the 2023 preseason top 5 teams passed the football.\",\n    subtitle = \"Both Ohio State and LSU fell out of the top 5 by the end of the season.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Maliik Jones  |  **Source:** College Football at Sports-Reference.com\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamFull == \"Ohio State Buckeyes\"|\n        TeamFull == \"LSU Fighting Tigers\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow well the 2023 preseason top 5 teams passed the football.\n\n\nBoth Ohio State and LSU fell out of the top 5 by the end of the season.\n\n\nTeam\nTotal Passing Percentage\nTotal Passing Yards\nTotal Passing Touchdowns\n\n\n\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide\n75.26667\n3086\n23\n\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs\n83.42500\n4274\n29\n\n\nLSU Fighting Tigers\n75.25833\n4406\n44\n\n\nMichigan Wolverines\n89.91667\n3205\n24\n\n\nOhio State Buckeyes\n69.10833\n3498\n26\n\n\n\nBy: Maliik Jones | Source: College Football at Sports-Reference.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see here passing percentage was a big factor comparing the three teams that stayed in the top 5 compared to LSU and Ohio State.

When they did run they still were able to average 5 yards per carry which is higher than Alabama’s run game.\nThe offensive game at a high level is insane, I mean Michigan and Georgia had 80+ passing completion percentage. As well as being able to average around 6 yards per carry on the ground. It’s like these top teams are completely unstoppable on this end of the ball."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The AP top 25 polls come in each week of the NCAA Basketball season. These are the compiled pollings from sportswriters and broadcasters all around the country. So, just how accurate are these rankings from the start of the season to the end.\nI took a look at the stats from the top five basketball teams from the preseason and then compared them to the stats of the final top five teams. Obviously, I’m not going to look at each and every category so I summed up defense into steals, blocks, and rebounds. Then I summed up offense into field goal percentage, three point percentage, and assist to turnover ratio.\nPersonally, I believe that these are purely guesses and it’s not possible to KNOW who’s going to be a top caliber team. Maybe you can tell if a team will win most of their games, but winning at a high level? College basketball has way too many factors and underdogs to truly know.\nAlso I wonder what really defines these teams and makes them top five in the country…\nLet’s peek at the preseason stats first:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbball &lt;- read_csv(\"logs24.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 11907 Columns: 48\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): Season, TeamFull, Opponent, HomeAway, W_L, URL, Conference, Team\ndbl  (39): Game, TeamScore, OpponentScore, TeamFG, TeamFGA, TeamFGPCT, Team3...\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\npretop5def &lt;- bball |&gt;\n  filter(TeamFull==\"Duke Blue Devils\" |\n         TeamFull==\"Kansas Jayhawks\" |\n         TeamFull==\"Marquette Golden Eagles\" |\n         TeamFull==\"Michigan State Spartans\" |\n         TeamFull==\"Purdue Boilermakers\") |&gt;\n  select(TeamFull, TeamSteals, TeamBlocks, TeamTotalRebounds) |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    TotalSteals = sum(TeamSteals),\n    TotalBlocks = sum(TeamBlocks),\n    TotalRebounds = sum(TeamTotalRebounds))\n\npretop5def |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    TeamFull = \"Team\",\n    TotalSteals = \"Total Team Steals\",\n    TotalBlocks = \"Total Team Blocks\",\n    TotalRebounds = \"Total Team Rebounds\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How the preseason top 5 teams competed on defense.\",\n    subtitle = \"Purdue was the only team to stay top 5 and they led in blocks & rebounds.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Maliik Jones  |  **Source:** College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com: AP Polls\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"green\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamFull == \"Purdue Boilermakers\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the preseason top 5 teams competed on defense.\n\n\nPurdue was the only team to stay top 5 and they led in blocks & rebounds.\n\n\nTeam\nTotal Team Steals\nTotal Team Blocks\nTotal Team Rebounds\n\n\n\n\nDuke Blue Devils\n227\n127\n1145\n\n\nKansas Jayhawks\n243\n133\n1116\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles\n310\n125\n1087\n\n\nMichigan State Spartans\n248\n132\n1112\n\n\nPurdue Boilermakers\n196\n135\n1335\n\n\n\nBy: Maliik Jones | Source: College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com: AP Polls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see that Purdue is a standout team compared to the other four.

So, is defense the big factor to build a real top five caliber squad? I guess it really does win games and championships as UConn went on to win it all last season.\nI also found it interesting that Purdue was the only team to stay in the top five from start to finish. Like I said, knowing who’s going to be the cream of the crop cannot be predicted perfectly."
