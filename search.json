    "text": "The AP top 25 polls come in each week of the NCAA Basketball season. These are the compiled pollings from sportswriters and broadcasters all around the country. So, just how accurate are these rankings from the start of the season to the end.\nI took a look at the stats from the top five basketball teams from the preseason and then compared them to the stats of the final top five teams. Obviously, I’m not going to look at each and every category so I summed up defense into steals, blocks, and rebounds. Then I summed up offense into field goal percentage, three point percentage, and assist to turnover ratio.\nPersonally, I believe that these are purely guesses and it’s not possible to KNOW who’s going to be a top caliber team. Maybe you can tell if a team will win most of their games, but winning at a high level? College basketball has way too many factors and underdogs to truly know.\nLet’s peek at the preseason stats first:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbball &lt;- read_csv(\"logs24.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 11907 Columns: 48\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): Season, TeamFull, Opponent, HomeAway, W_L, URL, Conference, Team\ndbl  (39): Game, TeamScore, OpponentScore, TeamFG, TeamFGA, TeamFGPCT, Team3...\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\npretop5def &lt;- bball |&gt;\n  filter(TeamFull==\"Duke Blue Devils\" |\n         TeamFull==\"Kansas Jayhawks\" |\n         TeamFull==\"Marquette Golden Eagles\" |\n         TeamFull==\"Michigan State Spartans\" |\n         TeamFull==\"Purdue Boilermakers\") |&gt;\n  select(TeamFull, TeamSteals, TeamBlocks, TeamTotalRebounds) |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    TotalSteals = sum(TeamSteals),\n    TotalBlocks = sum(TeamBlocks),\n    TotalRebounds = sum(TeamTotalRebounds))\n\npretop5def |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    TeamFull = \"Team\",\n    TotalSteals = \"Total Team Steals\",\n    TotalBlocks = \"Total Team Blocks\",\n    TotalRebounds = \"Total Team Rebounds\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How the preseason top 5 teams competed on defense.\",\n    subtitle = \"Purdue was the only team to stay top 5 and they led in blocks & rebounds.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Maliik Jones  |  **Source:** College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com: AP Polls\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"green\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamFull == \"Purdue Boilermakers\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the preseason top 5 teams competed on defense.\n\n\nPurdue was the only team to stay top 5 and they led in blocks & rebounds.\n\n\nTeam\nTotal Team Steals\nTotal Team Blocks\nTotal Team Rebounds\n\n\n\n\nDuke Blue Devils\n227\n127\n1145\n\n\nKansas Jayhawks\n243\n133\n1116\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles\n310\n125\n1087\n\n\nMichigan State Spartans\n248\n132\n1112\n\n\nPurdue Boilermakers\n196\n135\n1335\n\n\n\nBy: Maliik Jones | Source: College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com: AP Polls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see that Purdue is a standout team compared to the other four.

So, is defense the big factor to become a real top five caliber squad? I guess defense really does win games.\nI also found it interesting that Purdue was the only team to stay in the top five from start to finish. Like I said, knowing who’s going to be the cream of the crop cannot be predicted perfectly."
